What is Constructor ? Why we need it?
Constructor is used to initialise the instance variables of a class
Constructor name is same as class name
Constructor not return any thing because it just to initalization
If u write void in front of constructor , so it is become a function.
When u create an object then constructor is called.
Constructor can be overload
Every class has default constructor by default. But if u create any other constructor so the default will be killed. So u need to create both if u want to use both of them.
The default constructor is an empty one , it doesnâ€™t do any thing , if u want to initalize some value , u need to do explictly.

Good Encapsulation - private data members and public functions and bind in a single unit.
d) Data Hiding - e.g private 
Access Modifiers
i) private - with in the class.
ii) default - with in the package access
iii) protected - with in the package and outside the package using inheritance
iv) public- inside & outside the package.
